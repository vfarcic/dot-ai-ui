# PRD: Web UI for MCP Server Interaction

**Issue**: [#1](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai-ui/issues/1)
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: Medium

> *Migrated from [vfarcic/dot-ai#109](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/109)*

## Executive Summary

Create a web-based user interface that communicates with the DevOps AI Toolkit MCP server via its REST API. The Web UI provides visual, interactive interfaces for deploying applications, managing organizational patterns, and troubleshooting Kubernetes issues—offering an accessible alternative to CLI-based MCP clients like Claude Code.

**Key Technical Approach:**
- Separate repository from `dot-ai` MCP server
- Uses existing REST API gateway (no MCP protocol in Web UI)
- TypeScript types auto-generated from OpenAPI schema
- Direct React component rendering from semantic JSON responses
- **Visualization-only model**: UI displays rich visualizations, user interacts via chat/text
- **Typed content blocks**: MCP returns typed data (`image`, `cards`, `code`), UI renders appropriately
- **MVP: Server-generated images**: MCP generates Mermaid diagrams → SVG, UI simply displays them (no graph libraries needed)

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- MCP server provides powerful Kubernetes AI capabilities through CLI clients (Claude Code, Cursor)
- Users must use MCP-compatible editors or command-line tools to interact with the system
- No web-based interface exists for users who prefer browser-based interactions
- Visual data representation is limited in text-based CLI environments

### Pain Points
- **Accessibility Barrier**: Users unfamiliar with CLI tools or MCP clients can't easily access the system
- **Limited Visualization**: Complex Kubernetes data and AI recommendations are hard to visualize in text-only interfaces
- **User Experience Gap**: No graphical interface for exploring cluster capabilities, solutions, and deployments
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Difficult to share visual insights or collaborate on deployment decisions

## Success Criteria

### User Experience Success
- [ ] Users can interact with all MCP functionality through a web browser
- [ ] Chat interface provides intuitive conversation flow similar to Claude Code
- [ ] Complex data (cluster capabilities, recommendations, manifests) displays with visual representations
- [ ] Response time for MCP tool calls under 3 seconds for standard operations

### Technical Success
- [ ] Web UI successfully connects to and communicates with existing MCP server
- [ ] All current MCP tools accessible through the web interface
- [ ] Visual components render Kubernetes resources, deployment statuses, and AI recommendations
- [ ] System handles concurrent users without performance degradation

### Business Success
- [ ] Increased MCP adoption due to improved accessibility
- [ ] Positive user feedback on visual data representation
- [ ] Documentation demonstrates clear setup and usage workflows

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **DevOps Engineers**: Need visual overview of cluster capabilities and deployment status
- **Platform Engineers**: Want graphical interface for managing AI recommendations and solutions
- **Developers**: Prefer browser-based tools over CLI for exploring Kubernetes deployment options

### Secondary Users
- **Engineering Managers**: Need visual dashboards for understanding deployment patterns and cluster usage
- **Site Reliability Engineers**: Want graphical monitoring of AI-assisted deployment outcomes

## User Stories & Workflows

### Core User Journey
```
User opens Web UI → Authenticated session → Chat interface loads →
User types intent ("deploy web app") → MCP processes request →
Visual solution cards displayed → User types selection in chat →
MCP returns configuration questions as visualization → User types answers →
Deployment manifests shown with syntax highlighting →
User types "deploy" → Status updates shown graphically
```

**Note on Interaction Model**: Users interact via text/chat, not forms or buttons. The UI displays rich visualizations (graphs, cards, code), but all user input flows through the chat. This simplifies cross-platform compatibility and leverages AI's ability to interpret natural language.

### Detailed User Stories

**As a DevOps Engineer**, I want to:
- See cluster capabilities as interactive graphs/cards rather than text lists
- View configuration options as visual cards while typing my choices in chat
- View generated Kubernetes manifests with syntax highlighting and collapsible sections
- Monitor deployment progress through visual status indicators

**As a Platform Engineer**, I want to:
- Browse solution patterns through a visual catalog interface
- See organizational patterns visualized as relationship graphs
- Visualize resource dependencies as interactive graphs (Cluster Capability Map)
- Share deployment configurations via shareable URLs

**As a Developer**, I want to:
- Chat with the AI in a familiar interface similar to ChatGPT/Claude
- See deployment recommendations as visual comparison cards
- Preview deployment topology (how resources relate) before deploying
- Get visual feedback on deployment success/failure with actionable next steps

## Technical Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
```
[Web Browser] ↔ [Frontend (React)] ↔ [REST API] ↔ [Existing MCP Server] ↔ [Kubernetes API]
                      ↓
                Parse semantic JSON
                      ↓
                Render React components
```

### Technical Design Decisions

**Data Flow:**
```
MCP Server REST API → Semantic JSON → Web UI → Parse JSON → Render React Components
```

The MCP server's existing REST API gateway returns structured, semantic JSON. The Web UI:
1. Fetches OpenAPI 3.0 schema from `GET /api/v1/openapi`
2. Generates TypeScript types from OpenAPI schema
3. Makes REST API calls to `POST /api/v1/tools/{toolName}`
4. Parses semantic JSON from responses
5. Renders directly using React components

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- **Server stays UI-agnostic**: MCP server returns semantic JSON, no UI-specific formatting
- **Web UI controls presentation**: Full control over styling, layout, and interactions
- **OpenAPI provides contract**: Types generated automatically, no shared code needed
- **No transformation layer**: Direct rendering from semantic JSON to React components
- **Standard HTTP**: Simple REST API calls, no MCP protocol complexity in Web UI

**What We're NOT Doing:**
- Microsoft Adaptive Cards (unnecessary transformation layer for single-platform web app)
- MCP-UI or Remote DOM (returns HTML/components instead of data; couples server to UI)
- Server-driven UI (couples server to presentation logic, breaks other clients)
- MCP protocol in Web UI (REST API is simpler and sufficient)
- Custom UI protocol (semantic JSON from server is already structured)
- Complex form/button interactions (use chat-based input; AI interprets natural language)
- Cross-platform client SDKs (focus on Web UI first; other clients are future scope)

**Format Standardization:**
During Web UI development, if multiple tools return semantically identical data in different formats (e.g., questions, solutions, status), we will standardize these in the MCP server to:
- Simplify Web UI component architecture
- Provide cleaner OpenAPI schema
- Benefit all future clients

### Typed Content Blocks

MCP responses include typed visualization blocks that the UI renders based on type, not tool identity. This decouples visualization from specific tools.

**Visualization Types:**
```typescript
type Visualization =
  | { type: "text", data: string }
  | { type: "code", data: { content: string, language: string } }
  | { type: "table", data: { headers: string[], rows: string[][] } }
  | { type: "cards", data: { items: Card[] } }
  | { type: "image", data: ImageData }              // MVP: MCP-generated diagrams
  | { type: "graph", data: GraphData }              // Future: interactive graphs
  | { type: "tree", data: { root: TreeNode } }
  | { type: "diff", data: { before: string, after: string } }
  | { type: "progress", data: { steps: Step[], current: number } }

interface Card {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  metadata?: Record<string, string>;
}

// MVP: MCP generates images (Mermaid → SVG)
interface ImageData {
  format: "svg" | "png";
  content: string;                    // Inline SVG or base64-encoded PNG
  alt: string;                        // Accessibility description
  source?: "mermaid" | "graphviz";    // How the image was generated
}

// Future: Interactive graphs (requires D3/Cytoscape in UI)
interface GraphData {
  nodes: Node[];
  edges: Edge[];
}

interface Node {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  category?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface Edge {
  from: string;
  to: string;
  label?: string;
  relationship?: string;
}
```

**MVP Approach: Server-Generated Images**

For MVP, the MCP server generates diagram images using Mermaid, and the UI simply displays them. This dramatically simplifies the UI (no graph libraries needed) while still providing visual value.

| Visualization | MVP Approach | Future Enhancement |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Cluster Capability Map | Mermaid → SVG image | Interactive D3/Cytoscape graph |
| Remediation Flow | Mermaid flowchart → SVG | Interactive step-through |
| Deployment Topology | Mermaid → SVG | Interactive preview |
| Solution Cards | Structured data (cards type) | Same |
| Code/Manifests | Structured data (code type) | Same |

**Why Mermaid for MVP:**
- Deterministic output (same input = same diagram)
- Fast generation (milliseconds)
- No API costs (unlike AI image generation)
- High quality SVG output
- Well-suited for flowcharts, graphs, sequence diagrams

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
interface MCPVisualizationResponse {
  message: string;                    // AI's text response (rendered in chat)
  visualizations?: Visualization[];   // Visual elements to render
  prompt?: string;                    // Suggested follow-up question
  workflow?: {
    sessionId: string;
    progress?: { current: number, total: number, label?: string };
  }
}
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Here are the available solutions for PostgreSQL deployment:",
  "visualizations": [
    {
      "type": "cards",
      "data": {
        "items": [
          { "id": "sol-1", "title": "PostgreSQL Operator", "tags": ["HA", "recommended"] },
          { "id": "sol-2", "title": "Helm Chart", "tags": ["simple"] }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "prompt": "Which solution would you like? You can say 'the HA one' or 'compare them'.",
  "workflow": { "sessionId": "rec-123", "progress": { "current": 1, "total": 5 } }
}
```

### AI-Generated Visualization Data

For complex visualizations like the **Cluster Capability Map**, the AI generates the visualization. The MCP server doesn't just return raw capability lists—it uses AI to infer relationships and generate diagrams.

**MVP: AI → Mermaid → SVG Pipeline**
```
AI analyzes CRDs → Generates Mermaid code → Renders to SVG → Returns image
```

**Example: Capability Map Generation**
```typescript
// Instead of returning flat list:
{ capabilities: [{ kind: "VPC" }, { kind: "Subnet" }, { kind: "SecurityGroup" }] }

// MCP returns AI-generated Mermaid diagram as SVG:
{
  "visualizations": [{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
      "format": "svg",
      "content": "<svg>...</svg>",  // Rendered Mermaid diagram
      "alt": "Cluster capabilities: VPC contains Subnet and SecurityGroup. Subnet and SecurityGroup both require VPC.",
      "source": "mermaid"
    }
  }]
}

// The AI internally generated this Mermaid code:
// graph TD
//     subgraph Networking
//         VPC[VPC]
//         Subnet[Subnet] -->|requires| VPC
//         SG[SecurityGroup] -->|requires| VPC
//     end
```

The AI analyzes CRD schemas and infers:
- Logical groupings (networking, databases, observability)
- Dependency relationships (Subnet requires VPC)
- Composition patterns (resources typically deployed together)

**Benefits of Server-Side Image Generation:**
- UI is trivially simple (just display `<img>` or inline SVG)
- Same image works in Web UI, future Claude Code (with graphics), documentation
- AI controls the visualization logic, not the UI
- No graph library complexity in frontend

### Fallback Representations (Future-Proofing)

To support future clients with varying capabilities (e.g., Claude Code if terminal graphics are added), visualizations can include fallback representations:

```typescript
{
  type: "graph",
  data: { nodes: [...], edges: [...] },
  render: {
    mermaid: "graph TD; VPC-->Subnet; VPC-->SecurityGroup",
    ascii: "VPC\n├── Subnet\n└── SecurityGroup",
    text: "VPC contains Subnet and SecurityGroup"
  }
}
```

| Client | Renders |
|--------|---------|
| Web UI | Interactive graph from `data` |
| Future Claude Code (with graphics) | Mermaid or image |
| Current Claude Code | ASCII or text fallback |

**Note**: Fallback generation can happen server-side (MCP generates all formats) or client-side (client transforms `data`). Start with server-side for simplicity.

### Component Breakdown

**Frontend Application**
- **API Client**: TypeScript types auto-generated from OpenAPI schema
- **REST Communication**: Standard HTTP fetch/axios calls to MCP server
- **React Components**: Direct rendering (SolutionPicker, ManifestViewer, QuestionForm, etc.)
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) or shadcn/ui for base components
- **State Management**: User sessions, conversation history, deployment tracking

**Backend Integration (Minor Additions for MVP)**
- **MCP Server**: Existing REST API gateway at `/api/v1/*`
- **OpenAPI Endpoint**: Schema available at `GET /api/v1/openapi`
- **Tool Endpoints**: All tools at `POST /api/v1/tools/{toolName}`
- **CORS**: Already configured for cross-origin requests
- **New**: Mermaid.js integration for diagram generation (server-side rendering to SVG)

### Milestone 6: Production Deployment
- [ ] Production deployment pipeline setup
- [ ] Security review and hardening
- [ ] Performance monitoring and analytics
- [ ] User feedback collection mechanisms

**Success Criteria**: Web UI publicly available and monitored in production

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- **Authentication**: Determine if web interface needs user authentication (MVP may skip for internal use)
- **Authorization**: Kubernetes RBAC enforced by MCP server, not Web UI
- **Network Security**:
  - HTTPS for production Web UI deployment
  - CORS properly configured for allowed origins
  - API rate limiting if Web UI is public-facing
- **Input Validation**:
  - Client-side validation for UX
  - Server-side validation already in place (MCP server validates all inputs)
- **Secrets Management**: Web UI should never expose Kubernetes credentials or API keys

### Performance
- **REST API Calls**: Standard HTTP requests with proper loading states and feedback
- **Large Data Handling**: Pagination or virtualization for large cluster capability lists
- **Caching**: Client-side caching of cluster data, solution templates, and OpenAPI schema
- **Bundle Size**: Code splitting, lazy loading, tree shaking for fast initial loads
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Generated API types increase build time but provide type safety

### Scalability
- **Concurrent Users**: Multiple simultaneous web sessions connecting to single MCP server
- **Session Management**: Persistent conversations across browser refreshes
- **Resource Usage**: Frontend memory usage with large conversation histories

### Integration Challenges
- **OpenAPI Schema Drift**: Web UI TypeScript types must stay synchronized with REST API changes
  - Mitigation: CI/CD regenerates types from OpenAPI schema on every build
  - TypeScript compilation will fail if incompatible changes detected
- **REST API Versioning**: Managing breaking changes in REST API responses
  - Mitigation: OpenAPI schema versioning, semantic versioning for both repositories
- **State Synchronization**: Keeping web UI state consistent with MCP server state during multi-step workflows
  - Mitigation: Session management via sessionId in tool responses
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of REST API errors, timeouts, and network issues
  - Mitigation: Proper error boundaries, retry logic, user-friendly error messages
- **CORS Configuration**: Ensuring CORS settings allow Web UI to call REST API
  - Note: Already configured in dot-ai REST API gateway

## Dependencies & Risks

### Technical Dependencies
- **MCP Server REST API**: Web UI depends on existing REST API gateway in dot-ai
- **OpenAPI Schema Availability**: Requires `GET /api/v1/openapi` endpoint for type generation
- **CORS Configuration**: MCP server must allow cross-origin requests from Web UI domain
- **Kubernetes Access**: MCP server must have cluster access (Web UI is presentation layer only)
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+, fetch API, and modern JavaScript features

### Project Risks
- **Complexity Risk**: Web UI development may be more complex than anticipated
- **Maintenance Risk**: Additional codebase to maintain alongside MCP server
- **User Adoption Risk**: Users may prefer existing CLI tools over web interface
- **Performance Risk**: Web interface may be slower than direct CLI interaction

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic chat interface, add visual components incrementally
- **Reuse Patterns**: Leverage existing web UI component libraries and patterns
- **Early Feedback**: Get user feedback after each milestone to guide development
- **Performance Testing**: Regular performance testing with realistic data loads

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- Number of unique users per month
- Session duration and frequency of use
- Conversion from CLI to Web UI users

### Usage Metrics
- Most frequently used MCP tools through web interface
- Average time to complete deployment workflows
- User completion rates for multi-step processes

### Quality Metrics
