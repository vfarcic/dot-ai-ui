**Kubernetes Dashboard with AI Integration**

A new Kubernetes dashboard provides unified resource visibility and AI-powered operations in a single interface. Platform engineers, developers, and SRE teams can browse any Kubernetes resource—including Custom Resources—and trigger AI actions without switching between tools.

The dashboard automatically discovers all resource types in the cluster via Qdrant's indexed data and displays them in a grouped sidebar (core, apps, networking, custom CRD groups). Resource list views show real-time status with color-coded indicators: green for healthy states (Running, Active), yellow for pending operations (Terminating, Pending), and red for failures (CrashLoopBackOff, Failed). Detail views include Overview, YAML (with syntax highlighting and copy), Events, and pod-specific Logs tabs with live polling.

Four AI tools integrate directly into the dashboard. **Query** analyzes cluster health or answers natural language questions about resources. **Remediate** identifies root causes of issues and suggests fixes with one-click execution. **Operate** performs Day 2 operations (scale, update, rollback) by describing intent in plain English. **Recommend** guides deployments through a multi-stage wizard that applies organizational patterns and policies.

Semantic search (Cmd+K or Ctrl+K) finds resources across the cluster with relevance scoring. Results are grouped by kind and filtered by a configurable minimum relevance threshold (default 50%). Search queries persist across namespace and resource type changes.

Bearer token authentication protects the dashboard. Set `DOT_AI_UI_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable or let the server auto-generate a random token printed at startup. Helm users configure auth via the `uiAuth` values section.

See the [Dashboard Documentation](https://devopstoolkit.ai/docs/ui/) for screenshots and usage details.
