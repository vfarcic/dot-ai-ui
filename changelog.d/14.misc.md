**Playwright E2E Testing Infrastructure**

Automated end-to-end tests now run on every pull request, catching visual regressions and component rendering issues before they reach production. Previously, feature verification relied on manual Playwright MCP checks during development, with no automated protection against regressions.

The E2E test suite uses dot-ai's mock server for deterministic test data, ensuring reliable and non-flaky tests. Dashboard tests verify the sidebar resource list, namespace dropdown, and resource table functionality. Failed tests block PR merges, and screenshot artifacts are captured on failure for debugging.

Run tests locally with `npm run test:e2e` after starting the mock server (`docker compose -f e2e/docker-compose.yml up -d`). Use the `/generate-e2e-tests` skill to convert manual Playwright MCP verification into automated tests for new features.
